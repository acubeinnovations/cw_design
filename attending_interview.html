                <tr>

Interviews can be divided into two rough  types, interviews of assessment and interviews for information.<strong><u></u></strong></p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;">There are three steps for  an interview</p>
                          <div align="justify">
                            <ul type="disc" style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;">
                              <li>Preparation</li>
                              <li>Presentation</li>
                              <li>Personality</li>
                              </ul>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>1. Be Prepared!</strong><br>
                              Look at the employers' website and learn something about the company before you  attend your interview. Feed them the opportunity to talk proudly about  something positive you have found. This will boost your credibility with the  interviewer and will help you to formulate intelligent questions to ask him or  her.</p>
                          </div>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>2. Write down and practice possible  questions! </strong><br>
                            . Prior to your interview, prepare answers to common questions the interviewer  is likely to ask. Use the third person when talking about the job.<br>
                            <br>
  <strong>3. BE on time! </strong><br>
                            Be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes before the interview. And if worst comes  to worst and you are going to be late, then definitely ring in and let them  know. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. What are your weaknesses? </strong><br>
                            Try to find an area of your experience/skill that is currently lacking. An  interviewer will appreciate your can dour - as long as whatever you disclose  can be easily remedied</p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>5.  Bring necessary documentation.</strong> <br>
                            Make  a checklist of documents you will need for the interview and make sure you have  them in your briefcase before leaving home. These documents may include extra  copies of your résumé, a passport, driver’s license, photograph, Social  Security card, or portfolio of writing samples or other professional work. If  you are a recent graduate, you should also bring along your college  transcripts. <br>
                            <br>
  <strong>6. Check your CV for possible gaps! </strong><br>
                            Make sure you know how you are going to explain time gaps on your CV. <br>
                            <br>
  <strong>7.  Secure your references.</strong> <br>
                            Find  at least three key people -- former supervisors, colleagues, or instructors --  who are willing to serve as your professional references. Be sure to secure  their permission beforehand, and be certain that they will speak highly of you  if contacted by a potential employer. </p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>8. You never get a  second chance to make a first impression! </strong><br>
                              <br>
                            SMILE! <strong>Dress  professionally in simple business attire</strong>.. And don't forget that firm  handshake and to maintain eye contact - without glaring!<strong></strong></p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;""><strong>9.Be honest! <br>
                            </strong>There really is no point lying  about your background and/or skills.Job interviews are about matching needs -  if there isn't a good match, then chances are that the job won't work out<strong>&nbsp; <br>
                            </strong><br>
                            <strong>10. Talk about specific achievements! </strong><br>
                            Interviewers like to know how you felt about a particular success. Some will  ask for specific examples of things you've done that you're particularly proud  of; how you solved problems; how you learned - and improved - from difficult  situations.<br>
                            <br>
  <strong>11. Be enthusiastic and positive!</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on positive achievements and  views.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>12.And finally, don’t give up! </strong><br>
                            The fact is that you will not be offered every job however perfect you think  you may be for it. Usually it's because the interviewer was completely blind to  the talent that stood before them. However, just on the off chance that it was  not, feedback from interviews where you have been turned down can be invaluable  for improving future results. Ask politely if they can give you any feedback  for the future - there's a job out there for you somewhere.<br>
                            <br>
  <strong>13.Follow  up.</strong><br>
  &nbsp;After the interview, don’t forget to send a  handwritten note or friendly email thanking the interviewer for his or her time  and consideration, as well as restating your interest and commitment to the  position. If you don’t hear anything after one week, call to politely inquire  when they will be making a final</p>

                              <li>Don't treat the interview casually. This is an       insult to the interviewer and to the organization.</li>
                              <li>Don't give the impression that you are only       interested in an organization because of its geographic location</li>
                              <li>Don't give the impression you are only       interested in salary; don't ask about salary and benefits issues until the       subject is brought up by your interviewer.</li>
                              <li>Don't make the interviewer guess what type of       work you are interested in; it is not the interviewer's job to act as a       career advisor to you.</li>
                              <li>A job search can be hard work and involve       frustrations; don't exhibit frustrations or a negative attitude in an       interview.</li>
                              <li>Don't go to extremes with your posture; don't       slouch, and don't sit rigidly on the edge of your chair.</li>
                              <li>Don't assume that a female interviewer is       "Mrs." or "Miss." Address her as "Ms."       unless told otherwise. Her marital status is irrelevant to the purpose of       the interview</li>
                              <li>Don't chew gum or smell like smoke.</li>
                              <li>Don't take cell phone calls during an       interview. If you carry a cell phone, turn it off during the interview to       be sure it doesn't ring.</li>
                              <li>Don’t talk too much.</li>
