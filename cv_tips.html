                              <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>How long should it be? </strong><br>
                                  Two pages at the most.  Selectors rarely give CVs more than two minutes on their initial trawl 
                                  If you are a postgraduate,  you may wish to add an appendix detailing any research or publications. Don't  include this in the body of your CV - it will make it too long <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                                  <strong>What should it look like? </strong><br>
                                  Presentation is really  important - your CV needs to get its message over quickly <br>
                                  It should be word processed  on good quality paper - photocopying paper is usually a bit thin, but there is  no need to go for thick vellum! <br>
                                  Most people stick to white  paper - if you do choose a colour, think pastels. <br>
                                  Think about the layout - it  needs to be clear and balanced <br>
                                  Keep paragraphs short <br>
                                  Use bullet points <br>
                                  Font size of 10-12 -  smaller is difficult to read, larger looks like a primary school project! <br>
                                  Typeface - is a matter of  personal taste. Easy to read and no-nonsense. Times New Roman is a little more  formal and old fashioned, whilst Comic Sans MS is a bit casual! Try not to get  carried away - and once you've chosen a font - stick to it! <br>
                                  Lots of underlining and  italics can be distracting- use bold instead for headings <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                                  <strong>What should it include? </strong><br>
                                  CVs usually include the  following sections, but don't feel you have to follow this format  slavishly.&nbsp; <br>
                                  Personal Details <br>

                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>Should I use the same CV for every job? </strong><br>
                            Not really necessary to  alter it for individual employers - your covering letter is the place to  highlight things <br>
                            Can be useful to change it  for different types of employer <br>
                            Sometimes worth it if you  are applying for a job that needs particular skills or interests - advertising  or graphic design jobs for example</p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:15px;color:#3190A0;"><strong>What is a Personal Statement/Profile? </strong><br>
                            Often inserted between name  and personal details <br>
                            It summarizes experience,  skills and ambitions <br>
                            Can be useful for those in  mid career <br>
                            For example:<br>
                            Highly motivated and  committed to a career in the public sector. A good team worker with well  developed communication skills, gained through enthusiastic participation in  student and community organizations. Varied work experience, including a spell  with local authority play schemes. <br>
                            Try to avoid anything that  sounds like a personal mission statement <br>

                            <strong>I'm a mature student - how should I write a CV? </strong><br>
                            Try to anticipate any  problems you may face as a mature student within your CV <br>
                            Explain reasons for  returning to education, or changing your career <br>
                            Don't leave any gaps - if  you have taken time out to have a family, include this time <br>
                            Put a positive spin on any  experience you may have - for example, if you have been at home raising a  family emphasized skill such as:<br>
                            * time management -  juggling child care with study or part time work; dealing with several problems  at once, rarely without interruption<br>
                            * Negotiation skills -  vital in child rearing <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                            <strong>I want to work abroad eventually - can I use a CV? </strong><br>
                            CV format varies from  country to country - you must adapt to your market <br>
                            German employers are far  more interested in your academic qualifications than your extra curricular ones <br>
                            A résumé for the US market need  only be a page long
